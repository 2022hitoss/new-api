# Downstream Customizations

This repository is a downstream fork of QuantumNous/new-api.

Local customizations will be documented here.

## CI/CD (2026-09-21)

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — reduced to Linux amd64/arm64 only; the macOS and Windows release jobs were removed.
- `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml` — publishes to `ghcr.io/<owner>/new-api` instead of Docker Hub; authenticates with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` (no `DOCKERHUB_*` secrets needed).
- Disabled in repository settings (files kept unchanged for easier upstream merges): `electron-build.yml`, `sync-release-to-gitcode.yml`, `docker-image-branch.yml`.
